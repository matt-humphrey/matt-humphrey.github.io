# Optimism VS Positivity
## A journey through Slovenia

Having just summitted the Slovenian Alps, my friend Ant and I were eager for our next adventure. We decided to try our luck hitchhiking. Cardboard sign in hand, we ventured along the road with expectations high. However, our hopes were quickly dashed and after a couple of hours went by with no luck, we ditched Operation Freeload and shifted gear to Plan B – the bus. 

After treacherously zigzagging through the undulating Slovenian ranges, we arrived in a quaint town known as Trenta, located in the Julian Alps. The crystal Soča river pierced through the centre of the valley, surrounded by mountains covered in a luscious green veneer, thick with forest.

We longed for a feed, but first we stopped off at the local tourist bureau. It was one of only several buildings in a town comprising 114 people. After a pleasant conversation with the receptionist, we settled down outside on the grass to soak up the sun and have a bite to eat.
 
After a short while, we saw someone approaching. He was rather bedraggled, with long dreadlocks and so much gear hanging off him he looked like the backpacking incarnation of Enid Blyton's Saucepan Man.
 
He wandered over and introduced himself, and asked if we could use a spare gas cannister - the one he'd purchased was the wrong type for his portable stove. This ignited the conversation and we got chatting. He told us he was from Wales and was on a similar adventure, backpacking through the luscious countryside of Slovenia. He described an amazing hiking section along the river, where he’d come across a beautiful, concealed clearing in the forest where he was planning to set up camp.
 
Up until that point, Ant and I had been good boys and had been pitching our tents at proper campsites, but the prospect of a rent-free night under the stars all to ourself was a temptation we couldn't resist.
 
He led the way, and the short walk was stunning. We crossed an old, rickety bridge and only 15 minutes from town, we arrived at our campsite. It was more splendid than we had imagined. A secluded clearing in the woods, right near the Soča River. We decided to set up Chris' tarp as an A-Frame and all sleep under it, using our tent to store the rest of our gear. After multiple nights of intimately sharing what is deceivingly described as a ‘two-man’ tent, we were glad to have a little more breathing room. 
 
We set up, had a little wander round, and then decided it was time for an adventure. Located a hike out of Trenta is the source of the Soča River. The water springs from a cave with a small subterranean lake, which flows through a narrow gorge and opens up into the river. Having heard fables of this marvellous sight, we set out in search of our holy grail. 

Now one thing you need to know about Slovenia is that the weather can turn on a dime. We set off with clear blue skies, and not 20 minutes into the hike, the sky was shrouded in dark clouds and we were absolutely drenched. We attempted to take shelter unsuccessfully, and with storm clouds looming persistently, without a hint of blue sky, we decided to continue on our quest.

We trudged valiantly onwards for another hour, with each bend promising to be the last, only to reveal yet another long stretch between us and the source. It seemed we’d never make it. We finally yielded to the rain and paused under a nearby roof to take shelter and discuss our plan.

I found myself becoming increasingly miserable. We'd left our gear in our tent and had set up our sleeping bags under the A-frame, but the clearing was inclined, and it was likely the water was running down the slope and soaking our belongings. I wasn’t looking forward to the prospect of a cold and wet night’s sleep, and it seemed like we would never make it to the end of the hike. My mood continued to sour as our journey prolonged.

I reasoned with the others, arguing that it was looking increasingly unlikely we would reach our goal before dark and that we should simply cut our losses, but the others were intent to achieve our mission, and so we continued our journey. 

Soon after, Ant began to display signs of concern as well, worrying out loud about having our sleeping bags soaked and praying the rain would finally cease.
 
However, Chris remained completely unfazed by the ordeal, and instead maintained a bright and cheerful disposition, stating that regardless of our sleeping situation, we would deal with it in the future, and he assured us that we could make the best out of whatever circumstances we found ourselves in. 

He also maintained spirit, providing encouraging metaphors, comparing the final stretch of the hike to a gym leader in Pokemon. "They're just challenges you've got to surpass to level up. It's all a part of the game". He also commented sarcastically that it would make a great story later to tell our friends about that one time we made it three quarters of the way to the source of the Soča River. That spurred us on.
 
Unfortunately, the rain persisted, only becoming heavier, and darkness began to loom. We finally decided it was getting late, and without any head torches, we didn't want to risk losing our way (I had made that mistake on Bluff Knoll and I wasn't planning to let it happen again). And so, in spite of our long, tempestuous hike up until that point, we turned around and headed back into town. 
 
After continuing on despite my niggling internal monologue, convinced that we should have turned around long ago, I felt a sense of relief now that the bearing of my mind and feet were aligned. And yet, drenched to the core with the rain unceasing, I still felt miserable. 
 
It was when we were about a third of the way back that my state of mind changed dramatically. All of a sudden, I just decided to stop being miserable. Rather than allowing the weather to dictate my mood, I instead focused on the sensation of the rain and the cold, and suddenly the negative thought patterns fell away. It was not the sensations themselves that caused my suffering, but rather the incessant desire for them to go away. As soon as I simply experienced reality as it was, I felt a real sense of peace and joy. 
 
The rest of the way back into town was a rather pleasant experience, and naturally, we headed straight to the local pub. Tourists and locals alike were sitting around eating, and we garnered a number of looks of amusement and even astonishment as we sat down, dripping from head to toe. We each ate warm pub food and downed our respective alcoholic beverages. The other boys went a pint, but I decided to mix it up with a glass of Becherovka, a herbal bitters originating from the Czech Republic, and a favourite drink of my grandma. 
 
Feeling satiated after a warm meal, we noticed the weather had temporarily cleared up and decided to bolt for our campsite before a resurgent downpour. We made it back as the rain began to trickle again, and were overcome with relief seeing our belongings, particularly our sleeping bags, dry and sheltered from the rain. We changed into dry clothes under the tarp, warmed ourselves up in our sleeping bags, and feasted on an array of snacks. 
 
And so it was that we enjoyed a delightful night's sleep, sheltered under our tarp in a beautiful mossy green clearing in the midst of the Slovenian forest. We awoke the next morning to birds chirping and the sound of the Soča river gushing. There aren't many better settings to wake up to. 
 
We packed up our gear and strolled into town to the local bakery for some breakfast before parting ways with Chris and continuing on our own separate journeys. 

                                                                                                                                                                                            


This was one of the adventures that helped me to understand the joy and freedom that people experience when backpacking. To meet a stranger one day and the next to say goodbye to a friend. To share such intimate experiences with someone whom you'd never met only 24 hours prior. To experience a part of their world, and go on adventures you otherwise wouldn't have gone on. 

To travel reserved and closed-off is contradictory to the nature of travel. Being alone in an alien environment wedges open a part of oneself that's so easy to keep hidden in day-to-day life. You experience an openness and a vulnerability that substantially enhances the quality of time you spend with even strangers, because they're in the same position themselves. 
 
I also learned something from that exchange with Chris. I learned the difference between optimism and positivity. Optimism is grounded in hope. A somewhat unfounded belief that one’s circumstances will improve. That’s not to say it’s not useful – it absolutely can be – but only in situations where one’s attitude will influence the outcome of the situation.

If you’re playing a team sport and your team is losing, you should absolutely be optimistic that you can win, because you cannot expect to play your best and have a chance of obtaining victory without hope. But to be optimistic about something which you cannot control is to allocate your happiness to a roll of the dice, leaving it to fate. It’s to say, “I really hope something changes, because I’m not content with reality as it is”. 

Continued optimism with the desired outcome perpetually out of reach is unsustainable, and not a foundation for happiness. Instead, positivity is the key. The ability to not allow your future, or even your present happiness to depend on a certain outcome, and instead to proceed with an attitude of “I'll make the best of it, whatever happens”. 

It's Chris saying, "even if we find out our stuff is wet, we'll worry about it when it happens, and we'll be alright regardless". Not an empty platitude, but an attitude of preventing needless suffering or concern. An unrelenting fortitude to press on regardless of the circumstances, and to be happy whatever the result.
